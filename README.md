This repo used for archived the assignment of COMP3009 Information Retreval.

It is a very interesting assignment. It will give you the illusion that I can hand make an search engine.🥲

(There is a lesson at the end of this course devoted to modern search engines, and it will frustrate you.🫤)

## Introduction
**The program could work on both corpus(small / large)**

`search_{large|small}_corpus.py` could build index and search on both corpus(small / large). It will extract the documents, remove stopwords and use porter algorithm to stem the words. Then it will build index and store the data into `cache.json` for future use. For two modes, the program will use BM25 to rank the documents and return the top 15 documents.

`evaluate_{large|small}_corpus.py` could evaluate the result of `search_{large|small}_corpus.py` automatic mode. It will calculate:
- Precision
- Recall
- P@10
- R-precision
- MAP
- bpref
